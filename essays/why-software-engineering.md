## Got Any Games?
Going into software engineering is always a good bet for anyone looking to find a job in the technology industry. Not only is there a high demand for more workers, there is also a wide variety of opportunities available in various subdisciplines, such as cybersecurity and app development. My personal interests lie in game development, app development, and potentially web design, although I am open to working in any fields that require programming knowledge. Gaming in particular has been an interest of mine from a young age. Immersing myself into these virtual worlds, interacting with people, and just having fun were things that brought me great joy as a kid. Although I was far from the most experienced or skilled player out there, what really piqued my interest was *how* these games worked--for example, how was it possible to create different game modes and modify various aspects of my in-game character? I began to slowly explore these interests more as I got older. In high school, I created my own Flappy Bird knockoff game, dubbed SuperCat, for one of my final projects. I also learned how to use a framework called LÖVE to write basic 2D games in the programming language Lua.

Mobile application development is another field I would not mind going into, although I still have much to learn about it. For my sophomore project, I got my first taste of Android app development when I helped create a basic application in MIT AppInventor. This app displayed the current data to the user and allowed them to easily send a signal to reset the device whenever they desired. The following summer, I completed a course from Google which went through the basics of Kotlin, the main programming language used to write many modern Android applications. While I found the process of creating apps to be somewhat complicated, it was also extremely interesting to learn how to write my own basic applications and see how all its various aspects come together. 

## What’s Next?
Getting to work more with HTML/CSS this semester is definitely something I am looking forward to, as my web design experience is relatively limited. Furthermore, getting the chance to work with more industry standard programs and frameworks such as Git/GitHub and React.js will undoubtedly be helpful in expanding my skill set and preparing me for the workforce. In the future, I hope I can get more experience working with others in a team setting, and I am sure that my classes this semester will be beneficial to achieving that goal. I also want to branch out more in terms of my skills--becoming more proficient in other languages such as Python and applying that knowledge to creating my own personal projects are definitely things I want to do in the near future.
