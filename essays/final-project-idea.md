## Overview
*The problem:* Many UH Manoa engineering students struggle to find an updated listing of all the x96 projects that they can join. In addition, it can be somewhat of a hassle to individually contact each professor in their department about what projects they have available. Another issue is that it is difficult to gauge the number of students working on the project; some may prefer a specific group size or may want to work with specific individuals.

*The solution:* x96 Connect gives students a convenient way to view all the available engineering x96 projects on one convenient page. Each project listing will show the project name, a brief summary, and the faculty advisor. Furthermore, students can create an account and log in to view more detailed information about each project. This includes the list of students involved in the project and any videos or documentation.

## Approach
The landing page will have a list of available x96 projects where students would be able to view a brief summary of the project along with the project advisor. If you are not signed in you are only able to view this landing page and are unable to enter the project pages without an account.

If a user is part of the project then they will be able to edit the information on the project page that they are assigned to. These users will be able to add any information they see fit as they complete various steps of the project.

Users not part of a project will be able to view the project page and are able to see the entire project page. The project pages will include a more in-depth summary of the project along with details on class times and the members of the project. The project page also shows some of the past milestones and creations they have done.  A user will be able to filter out projects based on their interests so that they can view all projects that suit their interests. 

Mockup pages include:
- Landing Page
- Project Pages
- Browse projects by interest
- Edit pages where project users can edit information
- Admin home page

## Use case ideas
- New user goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign up”, sets up a profile, and is redirected back to the landing page (with expanded details about each project now visible).
- User goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign in”, enters their credentials, and is redirected to the landing page. They have the ability to edit any project pages that they are a part of.
- Admin goes to the landing page, clicks “Sign in”, enters their credentials, and is redirected to the landing page. They have the ability to update any project page and the website structure.

## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, some ideas for advanced features include:
- Support the ability to remove and add users to each project as people enter/leave the project.
- Support a FAQ page that users not in projects to add questions on the projects where they can be answered by others
- Support a project proposal page, which allows users to submit any project ideas they have. This can be viewed by other users (students and faculty), who can contact the author if they are interested in the project.
