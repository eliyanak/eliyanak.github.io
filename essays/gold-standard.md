## What standard?
Have you ever tried reading a snippet of code so poorly formatted that it made it nearly impossible to understand? Coding standards exist in the hope of preventing problems such as this and to establish an industry-wide standard that remains constant across multiple companies. While they might take awhile for some programmers to get used to, I believe that learning to follow these rules can prove to be extremely helpful not just for an individual, but also for entire companies and teams. Following an established standard across different iterations of teams will allow for more uniformity as the existing code is passed down and will make it much easier for future developers to understand its purpose.

Coding standards not only make a program more readable, but they also utilize protocols that make it run more efficiently. For example, it is widely accepted that functions should be utilized for tasks that are done repeatedly within a program. These functions should also generally each serve a single purpose and 
not be overly lengthy. Formatting is also vital to writing readable code. For example, indentations should be used when writing inside brackets, and whitespace should be inserted to separate different sections of code. Sufficient documentation through the use of comments is also vital for readability. 

## Personal remarks
To assist in the process of verifying that a program follows these standards, tools such as ESLint provide instant feedback on aspects of the code that can be fixed. My personal experience with ESLint after using it for a week has been mostly positive, although parts of the initial setup were a bit of a hassle. I do appreciate that it forces me to form good programming habits and follow industry standards. This will likely be extremely helpful for me in the future, when I hope to get a job in software development. However, it can get somewhat frustrating to correct certain things such as let to const, or to ensure that all my indentations and other whitespace are essentially perfect.
